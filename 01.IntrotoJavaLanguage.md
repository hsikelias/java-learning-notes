# The Way Java Works

1.) Source: Create a source doc, use an established protocol( java lang)
2.) Compiler: This runs your document, checks for errors and compiles only if everything is correct
3.) Output(code): The compiler creates a new doc, coded into Java **bytecode**
4.) Virtual Machines : Physical machines, virtual machine reads and run the bytecode.

# Code structure in Java

A **source code file**( with the .java extension) holds on class. The class represents a piece of your program. The class must go within a pair of curly braces.

**class** : 
```
public class Dog {
}
```
A class has one or more **methods**.Your methods must be declared inside a class

**method** : 
```
public class Dog {
  void bark() {
 }
}
```
Within the curly braces of a method, you write instructions for how that method should be perfomed.
So its basically a set of statementsðŸ˜›
**statements**
```
public class Dog {
  void bark() {
 }
}
```

The main() method is where your program starts running.

**1. do something** : declarations, assignments, method calls, etc.
**2. do something again and again** : Loops: for and while.
**3. do something under this condition** : if/else tests.


# Conditional branching

```
class IfTest {
public static void main (String [] args) {
   int x = 3;
   if (x ==3) {
        System.out.println("x must be 3");
     }
   System .out.println( " This runs no matter what");
 }
} ## Output: x must be 3
              This runs no matter what
```

So the above code runs only if the x is 3, if u cange the value of x.. the condition( x ==3) becomes false. So it all depends on the value of x. The only thing that wont change is the "runs no matter what thing".

But we can add an **else** to our condition, to give ourself more options.

```
class IfTest2 {
public static void main (String [] args) {
   int x = 2;
   if (x ==3) {
        System.out.println("x must be 3");
     } else {
   System.out.println( "x is NOT 3");
    }
      System.out.println("This runs no matter what");
 }
}
     ## Output: x is NOT 3
        This runs no matter what
```

# Packges and classes

Bundle of related classes that we can use in our program. So its like a folder in a file directory. We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and i guess better organization and maintainable code. Packages are divided into 2 categories: 
- Built-in Packages (Packages from the Java API)
- User- defined Packages( you make ur own packages)

The package java.util contains the collections classes. The package java.lang, contains many commonly used classes, is automatically provided to all Java programs. To use any other package in a program, an *import* statement must be used. To import all of the classes in a package called *packagename*, 

```
import packagename;
```
package name is all lowercase letters. To import a single clas called *ClassName* from package,

```
import packagename.Classname;
```
